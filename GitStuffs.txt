This is a new file!

To get this up to the remote repository. I need to...

1.get add. || git add -A || git add [filename] e.g git add newFile.txt
This will ensure that the file is TRACKED for changes.

2. git commit -m 'my commit message'
This captures a snapshot of the project's changes
:wq to escape Vim editor

3. git push to push your changes
